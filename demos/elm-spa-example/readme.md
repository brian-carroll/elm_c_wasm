## Richard Feldman's SPA example, compiled to WebAssembly

Serves as a vehicle to develop and debug the code generator, and motivation to expand the set of C kernel functions.

Richard's repo is a Git submodule of this one, so I can use the original source code. I just change the build system and the index.html file.
