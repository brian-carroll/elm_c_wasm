This helps to understand where perf differences come from.

{-| Analyse the contribution of Elm's `A2` helper function,
which implements currying but is not really needed in this case.
Remove it by post-processing the compiled JS using a Bash script.
This has little effect on JS but a huge effect on Wasm, suggesting the
browser is able to optimise it away for JS but not Wasm.
JS and Wasm give comparable results here, especially in Firefox.
