              Micro-benchmarks of some Elm functions compiled to Wasm and JS.<br />
              <b>Notes:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Wasm numbers are an order of magnitude slower than JS at
                  the moment. Partly because they're skewed by several effects
                  (see below) and partly because it's early days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The benchmarking loop crosses over and back across the JS/Wasm
                  language boundary on every iteration. This slows down the Wasm
                  cases a lot, distorting the results.<br />
                  In a real Elm program these language barrier crossings would
                  much less frequent or completely absent. But we're not ready
                  yet for full programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It also seems like crossing the language barrier is preventing
                  the browser engine from doing some optimisations that it can
                  do in the JS-only implementation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Wasm GC is using a ridiculously small heap size (64-128k)
                  because this made things more manageable during development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All of this means I don't trust the numbers, but the benchmark
                  format is very good for flushing out bugs and design flaws.

              Set up a test environment to allow an Elm program to be
              implemented partly in JS and partly in Wasm. Gives me a starting
              point to make incremental progress.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Basic up/down counter example, using <code>Int</code> for both
                  <code>Model</code> and <code>Msg</code> types
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only the <code>update</code> function is running in Wasm, the
                  rest is running in JS
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wasm <code>update</code> function is "hand compiled". I
                  manually wrote the C code that I think a future Elm compiler
                  could generate, then compiled that to Wasm.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Wasm is inserted into the Elm program by running the
                  generated JS through a Bash script. This would eventually be
                  done by the code generator in the Elm compiler.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This was an early demo. The "benchmark" example is more
                  developed.
